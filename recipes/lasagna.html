        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
        <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>            2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar
            <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
            <li>Salt
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put pasta water on to boil</li>
            <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</p>
            <li>Brown the ground beef</li>
            <li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef</li>
            <li>Transfer to medium sized pot, add tomatoes and remaining sauce ingredients to build the sauce</li>
            <li>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>Heat the oven to 375Â°F</li>
            <li>Assemble the lasagna</li>
            <li>Bake</li>
            <li>Cool and serve</li>
        </ol>
